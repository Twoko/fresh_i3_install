# Kali-Clean

- kali i3 desktop setup. 

After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh from a non-root user. This updates kali and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while. Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance` to customize.
